# Short description of this project
description: |-
  Terraform provider for performing various tasks that cannot be performed with the official
  [AWS Terraform Provider](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-aws) from Hashicorp.

  This provider is derived in large parts from the official HashiCorp AWS provider. We copied all the boilerplate
  functionality so that it follows the `terraform-provider-aws` conventions, but then removed all the standard resources
  and added in our own. This module is intended to be used as an escape hatch to accomplish all the hard things that
  will never be supported by the official provider due to strong (and valid) opinions of how providers should manage the
  lifecycle of a resource. Unfortunately, in the real-world we have to make tradeoffs to get stuff done. That's this
  provider in a nutshell.

#introduction: |-
#  This is an introduction.

# How to use this module. Should be an easy example to copy and paste.
usage: |-
  Here is how to use this provider in your own Terraform code:

  ```hcl
  terraform {
    required_providers {
      awsutils = {
        source = "cloudposse/awsutils"
        version = ">= 0.1.0"
      }
    }
  }

  provdier "awsutils" {
    region = "us-east-2"
  }
  ```
  See the [Docs](./docs) for additional information.

# Example usage
examples: |-
  Here is an example of using this provider:

  ```hcl
  terraform {
    required_providers {
      awsutils = {
        source = "cloudposse/awsutils"
      }
    }
  }
  ```
