Terraform provider for performing various tasks that cannot be performed with the official
[AWS Terraform Provider](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-aws) from Hashicorp.

This provider is derived in large parts from the official HashiCorp AWS provider. We copied all the boilerplate
functionality so that it follows the `terraform-provider-aws` conventions, but then removed all the standard resources
and added in our own. This module is intended to be used as an escape hatch to accomplish all the hard things that
will never be supported by the official provider due to strong (and valid) opinions of how providers should manage the
lifecycle of a resource. Unfortunately, in the real-world we have to make tradeoffs to get stuff done. That's this
provider in a nutshell.

## Usage



Here is how to use this provider in your own Terraform code:

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    awsutils = {
      source = "cloudposse/awsutils"
      version = ">= 0.1.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "awsutils" {
  region = "us-east-2"
}
```
See the [Docs](./docs) for additional information.




## Examples

Here is an example of using this provider:

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    awsutils = {
      source = "cloudposse/awsutils"
    }
  }
}
```

Here are some additional examples:

- [`examples/resources/awsutils_default_vpc_deletion`](/examples/resources/awsutils_default_vpc_deletion/)



## Developing the Provider

If you wish to work on the provider, you'll first need [Go](http://www.golang.org) installed on your machine (see [Requirements](#requirements) above).

To compile the provider, run `go install`. This will build the provider and put the provider binary in the `$GOPATH/bin` directory.

To generate or update documentation, run `go generate`.

In order to run the full suite of Acceptance tests, run `make testacc`.

_Note:_ Acceptance tests create real resources, and often cost money to run.

```sh
$ make testacc
```

### Testing Locally

You can test the provider locally by using the [provider_installation](https://www.terraform.io/docs/cli/config/config-file.html#provider-installation) functionality.

For testing this provider, you can edit your `~/.terraformrc` file with the following:

```hcl
provider_installation {
  dev_overrides  {
    "cloudposse/awsutils" = "/path/to/your/code/github.com/idanhaitner/terraform-provider-noname/"
  }

  # For all other providers, install them directly from their origin provider
  # registries as normal. If you omit this, Terraform will _only_ use
  # the dev_overrides block, and so no other providers will be available.
  direct {}
}
```

With that in place, you can build the provider (see above) and add a provider block:

```hcl
required_providers {
    awsutils = {
      source = "cloudposse/awsutils"
    }
  }
```

Then run `terraform init`, `terraform plan` and `terraform apply` as normal.

```sh
$ terraform init

Warning: Provider development overrides are in effect

The following provider development overrides are set in the CLI configuration:
 - cloudposse/awsutils in /path/to/your/code/github.com/idanhaitner/terraform-provider-noname

The behavior may therefore not match any released version of the provider and
applying changes may cause the state to become incompatible with published
releases.
```

```sh
terraform apply

Warning: Provider development overrides are in effect
